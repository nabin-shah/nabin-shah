Hello there! I'm Nabin, a Computer Engineering student with a strong interest in both software and hardware. 
My primary focus is on Java full-stack development, where I enjoy building robust web applications using technologies like Java, Spring Boot, JDBC, and MySQL. I also have experience with front-end technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Beyond Java, I've explored Python for projects in areas like simulation and have a foundational understanding of Machine Learning, databases and system administration.

Feel free to explore my repositories to see my coding journey and projects. I'm always open to connecting and learning!
